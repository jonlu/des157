						<p>Let’s take a look at Spotify.com. Making use of a variety of album covers as images, Spotify showcases popular titles at any viewport width. Let’s begin with the design as viewed on mobile: each section of the page is accompanied by an image that accentuates the text, and is distinguished by different background colors or images. Very little padding can be seen on the sides due to the restricted screen size.
</p>


						<p>As the screen is expanded to a typical vertical iPad viewing width, we can still see the hamburger menu icon for navigation, but there becomes a more defined grid in the body sections and increased padding. Spotify can also take a few more creative liberties with how images are displayed: instead of being confined to the same column, the images of each section are instead placed to the side of the text and resized to take up more screen space. Additionally, Spotify shows some animations and fade effects when displaying each section.</p>

						<p>Finally, as the screen is resized for desktop, we can see a full range of animations and images. The grid expands slightly, however the most drastic difference is the additional space for images - instead of adding more images, Spotify shows more of the original image, creating a seamless viewing experience on any medium. </p>
