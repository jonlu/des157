Trillions of years ago, *Bill Cipher* originated from the second dimension. *Bill*, however, despised living there, and burned it down along with everything it had ever known, including its own *parents*. It eventually took over a *boiling*, shifting intergalactic rift between dimensionsâ€”a *strange* space known as the *Nightmare* Realm. Without a physical form, *Bill* could only access the *dreams* of the dimension's beings. Those who were touched by the nightmarish *Nightmare*s in the *dream*world were fated to insanity.
