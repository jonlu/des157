    <p>After reviewing situations with Wenyu and Quishi, I came to the conclusion that my target demographic rarely (if ever) walks home alone after going out for a night. Such occasions are almost always planned in advance with a friend or at least a plan to return home safely. However, Quishi brought up scenarios in which she did indeed have to walk home: mostly after late classes that none of her friends were in. This brought up a valid point that I had not previously considered, though it makes a lot of sense.  </p>
