    <h2>Target Audience Test Results</h2>

    <p>From the audience tests, I learned that working and handling the map was easy. This was my main goal, as the map functions as the main landing page for the entire app. My two testers helped me understand that my app had familiar features, but also needed work in its functionality as a whole. </p>

    <p>From the experience, I will be modifying my prototype to increase its overall functionality to achieve the intended goal, as well as streamlining the login process.</p>

    <p>Note that no visual documentation can be provided, as I was demoing the application using my cell phone.</p>
